This is the first chapter of my file.

Git is used to track changes in our project, version control, and also has the ability to roll back the project to earlier build.

To use git on a project it needs to be initialized first - git init

In order to track file we need to add it to GIT staging area using command - git add <filename.txt>

Check if the files are in staging area or modified by using - git status

Then commit the file -
git commit -m "Commit message Here."

If you have changed the content of file and want to check the difference between current state and last version state then - git diff <filename.txt>

If you want to revertback/rollback to last version then use - git checkout <filename1.txt>
