This is the first chapter of my file.

Git is used to track changes in our project, version control, and also has the ability to roll back the project to earlier build.

To use git on a project it needs to be initialized first - git init

In order to track file we need to add it to GIT staging area using command - git add <filename.txt>

Then commit the file -
git commit -m "Commit message Here."
